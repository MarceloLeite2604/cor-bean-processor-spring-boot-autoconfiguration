# Chain Of Responsibility (COR) Bean Processor Spring Boot Starter

**TL;DR:** You focus on the logic while we handle the chain!

# What is this about?
COR Bean Processor is a library to assist creating [Chain Of Responsibility design patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain-of-responsibility_pattern) on Spring
Boot projects. It automatically chain all links together, reducing the amount of non-business code required in the project.

# How to use it?

1. Be sure to add [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/guides/gs/spring-boot/) to
   your project.
2. Add COR Bean Processor Spring Boot Starter on your project.
    1. For Maven projects add the following on your `pom.xml` file
       under `<dependencies>` tag.
   ```xml
   <dependency>
     <groupId>com.figtreelake</groupId>
     <artifactId>cor-bean-processor-spring-boot-starter</artifactId>
     <version>1.0</version>
   </dependency>
   ```

    2. For Gradle projects add the following on your `build.gradle` file
       under `dependencies` declaration.
   ```groovy
   implementation 'com.figtreelake:cor-bean-processor-spring-boot-starter:1.0'
   ```
    3. You can check the latest version available
       on [Maven Central repository](https://mvnrepository.com/repos/central).
3. Make your Chain Of Responsibility link classes implement [ChainLink][1]
   interface.
4. Add a [ChainLink][1] interface field on the class where ou need your chain and annotate it with either [@Autowired](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/beans/factory/annotation/Autowired.html) or [@Inject](https://docs.oracle.com/javaee/6/api/javax/inject/Inject.html) (if you are using Javax Inject) 
5. That is it! COR Bean Processor will automatically create the chain and Spring Boot will inject its first list into the target class.

# FAQ

***Q:** Does COR Bean Processor handles multiple chains?*

**A:** Yes! As long as each [ChainLink][1] implementation declares a different type on its template, the library will concatenate each link group separately. For more details about it check [multiple chains project inside the example repository](https://github.com/MarceloLeite2604/cor-bean-processor-examples/tree/main/multiple-chains-example).

<br/>

***Q:** What if my links must be concatenated in a specific order?*

**A:** You can annotate your links with [@Order](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/core/annotation/Order.html). The library will respect the specification and chain links in the defined order. For more details check [ordered links inside the example repository](https://github.com/MarceloLeite2604/cor-bean-processor-examples/tree/main/chain-with-ordered-links-example). 

<br/>

***Q:** I need one link to be the first of my chain. Do I need to add [@Order](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/core/annotation/Order.html) annotation on all my links?*

**A:** No. Just add [@Primary](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/context/annotation/Primary.html) annotation on your first link and the library will use it as the first chain element. For more details check [chain with primary link example](https://github.com/MarceloLeite2604/cor-bean-processor-examples/tree/main/chain-with-primary-link-example).

## How can I contribute?

Try out the library. If you like the outcome, give a star for its repository, share or talk about it with your IT friends and colleagues. This is a work I have been doing in my spare time and I really would like to see that people appreciate the time I have invested on it.

If you liked the project and *really* want to demonstrate your appreciation, you can send me a "thank you" coffee. ðŸ™‚

This library was implemented after
reading [Spring Boot - Auto Configuration](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/1.3.8.RELEASE/reference/html/using-boot-auto-configuration.html)
and [Spring Boot Features - Developing Auto Configuration](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.0.0.M3/reference/html/boot-features-developing-auto-configuration.html#boot-features-custom-starter)
documentation sections.

Also, thanks to [StÃ©phane Nicoll](https://github.com/snicoll) and
his [spring-boot-master-auto-configuration](https://github.com/snicoll/spring-boot-master-auto-configuration)
repository which helped me understand the minor details necessary to create a
Spring starter library.
